Problem Statement
Bob has two sequences x and y, each of length N, consisting of non- negative integers. The i- th elements of x and y are xi​ and yi​, respectively. Bob wants to know the number of good non- negative integers. A non- negative integer a is said to be good when the following condition is satisfied:
Condition: It is possible to permute y so that xi​ XOR yi​=a holds for every integer i such that 1≤i≤N, where XOR is the bitwise XOR.
Print all good integers in ascending order.
Input
First line contains a single integer N.
Next line contains n space separated integers (x1, x2, … xn)
Last line contains n space separated integers (y1, y2, … yn)

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1≤N≤2000
0≤xi​, yi​<2^30
Output
In the first line, print K, the number of good integers. Then, print K more lines. In the i- th of these K lines, print the i- th smallest good integer
