# Problem Statement:-

You have an empty sequence A. Along with that you are given an array B of size N.
You create a new integer i = 0 and perform N operations on the sequence A in the following way:

@Check if i == N + 1, break.
@Append Bi to the end of A and increment i by 1.
@Reverse the sequence A.

Find the sequence A after all the operations.

# Input:-

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line of the input contains N space seperated integers.

# Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Bi <= 109

# Output:-
Print the sequence A after all the operations.

# Example:-
Sample Input:
4
1 2 3 4

Sample Output:
4 2 1 3

# Solution:-
