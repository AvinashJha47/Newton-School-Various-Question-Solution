Problem Statement
Bob has two boxes, yellow and green, and N card packs. Initially, both boxes are empty. Each card pack contains two cards with integers written on them. We know that the i- th card pack contains a card with xi​ and another with yi​.
For each card pack, Bob will put one of its cards in the yellow box, and the other in the green box.
After Bob put all cards in the boxes,
Calculate the score:
a) Let A = GCD(all integers in the yellow box).
b) Let B = GCD(all integers in the green box).
Bob score will be the least common multiple of A and B.
Find the maximum possible score Bob can achieve.
Input
The first line contains and integer N
The ith of the next N line contains 2 integers, xi and yi.

Constraints:
All values in input are integers.
1≤N≤50
1≤xi​, yi​≤10^9.
Output
Print the maximum possible score.
