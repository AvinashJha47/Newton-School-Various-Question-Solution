# Problem Statement:-

Sara is standing in a line for her turn to see the doctor.
There are N people standing in front of Sara and for each person, the doctor takes exactly X minutes.

        int N= sc.nextInt();
        int X= sc.nextInt();
        int Time_Taken= N*X;
        System.out.println(Time_Taken);
    }
}
