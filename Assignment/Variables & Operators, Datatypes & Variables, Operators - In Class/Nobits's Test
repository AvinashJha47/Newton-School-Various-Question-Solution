class Main
{
    public static void main (String[] args)\
    {
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        int D= sc.nextInt();
        int Q= sc.nextInt();
        if(Q==0)
        {
            System.out.println(-1);
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println(D/Q);
        }
