# Problem Statement:-

Sara is fond of ice- cream initially she had N icecreams with her.
If Sara eats exactly half of the ice cream she has in a day and the remaining icecreams get tripled each night.
How many ice creams does Sara have at the end of D days?

Note:- Take floor value while dividing by 2.

# Solution:-

static int Icecreams (int N, int D){
//Enter your code here
// int i= D;
for(int i=D; i>0;)
    {
        i--;
        N=N-N/2;
        N*=3;
    }
        return N;
}
