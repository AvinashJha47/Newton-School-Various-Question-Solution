# Problem Statement:-

For a given integer N, super primes are those integers from 1 to N whose multiples (other than themselves) do no exist in the range [1, N].
Your task is to generate all super primes <= N in sorted order.

Note: Super primes are not related to primes in any way.

# Solution:-

public static void SuperPrimes(int n)
{
    int x = n/2+1;
	  for(int i=x ; i<=n ; i++)
    {
		    System.out.printf("%d ",i);
	  }
}
